## Introduction

Hello there, I'm Teik Jun! I'm currently a student at the National University of Singapore.

## This summer
I'm working on an open-source project called [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) this summer. Docusaurus is a static site generator tailored for documentation sites. Docusaurus is basically an npm package that generates a site fully equipped with documentation features out of the box.

Docusaurus uses Javascript + React on the frontend, and Typescript on the backend. One cool feature that I worked on was validating user’s configuration for Docusaurus plugins, so that incorrect configuration by users will fail fast and send a warning to the user. Currently, I’m working on a migration tool to migrate Docusaurus v1 site automatically to v2.

## Takeaways 
One of my main takeaways this summer is learning the best practices when working large codebases. The maintainers at Docusaurus ensure that all PRs has a good test plan. This includes E2E testing, automated tests using Jest and sometimes manual tests. This has been very helpful for preventing regressions and weird side effects.
