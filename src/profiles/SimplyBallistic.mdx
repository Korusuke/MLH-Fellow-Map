Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan, an Aussie first year, who has a passion for making a difference, all through the power of code!

I'm currently working on a few exciting projects at my time with MLH with the most prominent one being [PRISM.](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/prism)
PRISM by the World Food Program aims to try help governments better understand the prospects of third world countries and where help is most needed.

In my own time, I also work on [50 Raw](https://50raw.com.au), a newly released education site for high-schoool students.
